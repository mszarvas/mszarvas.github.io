    - Andrey Ignatov, Nikolay Kobyshev, Kenneth Vanhoey, Radu Timofte, Luc Van Gool
    - Good literature overview
    - Creates database of point and shoot and DSLR camera images
    - Explains how to align: SIFT + Homography via RANSAC
    - Explains error function
    - Explain issues of MSE error, related to lack of proper alignment -- no matter what, there exists alignment noise and perfect alignment via homogaraphy is not possible
